#📘 Student Management System – Assignment 3

A Java console-based application that demonstrates exception handling, multithreading, wrapper classes, and input validation. This implementation follows the exact requirements from the assignment document.

#🚀 Features

#✔ Input Validation
Checks for empty name, email, course
Ensures marks are between 0 and 100
Handles incorrect numeric input using try-catch
✔ Exception Handling
Uses:

try-catch-finally
NumberFormatException
Custom exception: StudentNotFoundException
✔ Multithreading
Simulates a loading animation using a separate thread:

Loading.....
(Implements Runnable → Loader class)

✔ Wrapper Classes
Uses:

Integer for roll number
Double for marks
Demonstrates autoboxing and data conversion
✔ Student Record Management
Add a student
Store using HashMap
Display student details
Validate input
Auto-calculate grade
🧰 Technologies & Concepts Used
